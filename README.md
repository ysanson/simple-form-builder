# Simple-form-builder

## Description

This component library aims to help simplify the creation of dynamic forms.
By using a form definition describing inputs, users can create, store and generate forms to be used in an application.

## Dependencies

This library is based on the fantastic [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com) library for validations and input management.

For the input list, we use the [react-sortablejs](https://github.com/SortableJS/react-sortablejs) library.
